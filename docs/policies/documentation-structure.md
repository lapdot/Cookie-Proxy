# CookieProxy Documentation Structure

This document defines the authoritative documentation-structure contract for CookieProxy.

If documentation entrypoints and this policy diverge, align the entrypoints to this document unless a newer repo decision supersedes it.

## 1. Goals

### 1.1 Primary goals
- Keep agent-first and human-first entrypoints distinct.
- Make repository navigation explicit for both agents and humans.
- Keep authoritative detail in canonical docs instead of duplicated top-level summaries.

### 1.2 Non-goals
- Defining a broad writing-style guide for all project documentation.
- Replacing runtime, testing, architecture, workflow, or planning documents.

## 2. Top-Level Documentation Roles

### 2.1 `AGENTS.md`
- `AGENTS.md` is the portable cross-project agent guide.
- It is an agent-first entrypoint.
- It should contain reusable agent working rules and one repository-specific handoff to `CONTEXT.md`.
- It is the preferred home for portable operating principles that can be reused across repositories.
- It must not carry repository-specific operational detail beyond that handoff.

### 2.2 `CONTEXT.md`
- `CONTEXT.md` is the top-level agent-first repository entrypoint.
- It should summarize repository purpose, primary surfaces, canonical commands, source-of-truth docs, reading order, and key repository-specific operating notes.
- It should stay concise and route readers to canonical docs rather than duplicating their full contents.

### 2.3 `README.md`
- `README.md` is the top-level human-first onboarding and usage entrypoint.
- It should explain what the project does, how to use it, and how to navigate deeper docs.
- It remains human-first even when it includes a documentation map.

### 2.4 `docs/README.md`
- `docs/README.md` is the index and taxonomy for the `docs/` tree.
- It should organize active reference docs, archive material, and recommended reading order inside `docs/`.
- It is not the top-level agent-first repository entrypoint.

## 3. Reference Contract

### 3.1 Required reference flow
- `AGENTS.md` points to `CONTEXT.md`.
- `CONTEXT.md` points to `README.md`, key canonical docs, and `docs/README.md`.
- `docs/README.md` routes readers deeper within `docs/`.

### 3.2 Handoff rule
- `AGENTS.md` should keep a single repository-specific handoff.
- The required handoff target is `CONTEXT.md`.

### 3.3 Canonical-doc routing rule
- `CONTEXT.md` should link directly to high-value canonical docs when they define current project behavior.
- `docs/README.md` may also be linked as the broader docs index, but it should not be the only route to core contracts.

### 3.4 Anti-duplication rule
- Top-level entrypoints should not each maintain their own competing navigation logic.
- Structural explanation should be centralized in this policy.
- Detailed behavioral truth should remain in the specific canonical policy, workflow, architecture, or decision doc that owns it.

## 4. Content Boundaries

### 4.1 Portable vs repository-specific content
- Portable agent rules belong in `AGENTS.md`.
- Portable operating principles that are intended to survive reuse across repositories should also live in `AGENTS.md`.
- Repository-specific agent-first context belongs in `CONTEXT.md`.
- Human-first onboarding and usage content belongs in `README.md`.
- Internal docs-tree organization belongs in `docs/README.md`.

### 4.2 Summary boundary
- Top-level entrypoints may contain short summaries that help orientation.
- They should not duplicate detailed contracts already defined elsewhere.

### 4.3 Source-of-truth boundary
- Runtime behavior belongs in runtime policy docs.
- Testing and safety requirements belong in testing policy docs.
- GUI and bridge behavior belongs in GUI policy docs.
- Structural explanation belongs in architecture docs.
- Accepted rationale belongs in decision records.

## 5. Maintenance Rules

### 5.1 Coordinated updates
- When documentation structure changes, update all affected entrypoints together.
- If the structure contract changes, update this policy and every top-level file whose role or references are affected.

### 5.2 New root-level Markdown files
- New root-level Markdown files are discouraged by default.
- Add one only when its role cannot fit `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, or `docs/`.
- Any new root-level Markdown file should have an explicit, non-overlapping purpose and a brief justification in the change that introduces it.

### 5.3 Prefer canonical detail over duplicated summaries
- When a detailed rule already has a canonical home, top-level docs should link to it instead of restating it at length.
- If a summary becomes misleading or stale, reduce it and keep the canonical reference.

### 5.4 Tracked planning artifacts
- Substantial implementation work that is split into phases, batches, or likely sessions should have a tracked in-repo planning document.
- For CookieProxy, the current established planning location is `docs/plans/`.
- This planning-location rule is a repository-specific convention owned by this policy, not a portable cross-repository requirement.
- Tracked plan documents should be updated as phases or batches complete so the stored plan reflects current status.

### 5.5 Link maintenance
- When documents are moved or renamed, update existing inbound references in the same change.
- Archived documents may keep historical content, but they should add a short note pointing readers to the active canonical replacement when one exists.

## 6. Validation Scenarios

### 6.1 Agent entry
- A new agent should be able to start at `AGENTS.md`, reach `CONTEXT.md`, and then find the key canonical docs needed for implementation work.

### 6.2 Human entry
- A human should be able to start at `README.md`, understand the project at a high level, and find deeper docs without using `AGENTS.md`.

### 6.3 Docs-tree navigation
- A reader entering through `docs/README.md` should understand that it is the index for `docs/`, not the top-level agent-first repository entrypoint.

### 6.4 Future maintenance
- A contributor should be able to decide whether a new document belongs in `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/`, or a rare new root-level file by using this policy alone.
